# Grading script

This repository includes a script that you can use to approximate what your
actual grade will be. The script is called `grade.sh`, and it can be executed
from within your project directory via:

`bash grade.sh`

Alternatively, you can mark `grade.sh` as an executable file via the following
command:

`chmod u+x grade.sh`

Once `grade.sh` is marked as executable, you can run it just like any other
executable file (e.g., `./grade.sh`)

Disclaimer: `grade.sh` is similar but not identical to the actual grading
script that will be used to compute your assignment grade. It only produces
an approximation of what your grade will be. Hard-coding solutions in an effort
to fool the grading script will not work; it will only overestimate what your
actual grade will be.

The grading script gives you a grade out of 80. A max of 20 more points can be
earned when your randomly assigned TA grades your code based on style.

This assignment has no demo, so there are no points allotted to Q&A.
